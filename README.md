 # Calculator

**Link to project:** http://3dvkr.github.io/calculator/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

This calculator calculates arithmetic expressions as they are entered (as opposed to following order of operations). Inputs to the calculator can come from clicking the calculator on screen, or using your keyboard.

## Lessons Learned:

- choosing a11y-friendly colour palettes
- flexbox layouts
- fixed bug: 'Enter' after clicking buttons with a mouse used to repeat the most recently clicked button in the display. I added a `.blur()` to remove the focus.
